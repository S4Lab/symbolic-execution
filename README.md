# SymbolicExecution

This repository contains an implementation of the forward symbolic execution based on the LDMBL API.
Less Duplication, More Business Logic (LDMBL) is a Pin-based architecture which provides flexible and abstract API for heavy weight dynamic binary instrumentation use cases. A sample use case is the forward symbolic execution which requires instrumenting all assembly instructions to track the specific logics of each instruction symbolically.
This repo is a subproject of the Twinner automatic deobfuscation framework.

## Installation

Use make files.

## Usage

Run the SE pintool as follows for the usage details:

    pin -t ./obj-intel64/SE.so -h -- echo test
